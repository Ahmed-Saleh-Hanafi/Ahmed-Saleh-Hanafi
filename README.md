I’m a final-year Computer Science student from Luxor, Egypt, with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.  
- My goal is to become a **Computer Vision Engineer** and contribute to solving real-world problems.
- [My portfolio](https://github.com/Ahmed-Saleh-Hanafi/my-portfolio/blob/main/README.md) Explore my journey in problem solving, software projects, and AI, ML, DL, and Computer Vision.

Under the mentorship of **Dr. Mostafa S. Ibrahim** (Senior Computer Vision Engineer at **NVIDIA, US**), I have built a solid foundation in:

- Python Programming & OOP  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Libraries & Tools: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas  
- Machine Learning  

This mentorship has been instrumental in enhancing my theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.  
I regularly apply this knowledge by solving algorithmic and data structure problems on [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/u/Eng_Ahmed_Saleh/).
